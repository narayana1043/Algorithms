"""
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15, 1, 4], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
